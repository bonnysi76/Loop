Finding Myself Through Heartbreak and Music: An Interview

“I gave her everything. My time, my heart, my trust—everything. I knew she could hurt me; deep down, I think I always knew. But I chose her anyway. She was the kind of person who made you feel like the world was smaller when you were with her, like nothing outside of that moment mattered. And yet, despite all of that, she broke my heart. It wasn’t just the end of a relationship—it was like losing a piece of myself.”

As Bonny sits across from me, there’s a weight in his voice, an emotional gravity that pulls you in. He speaks of his heartbreak with the kind of raw honesty that feels rare these days. It’s clear this wasn’t just about a breakup—it was about the unraveling of an identity built around someone else.

“I thought she completed me,” he continues, his eyes distant, searching for something in the air. “It sounds dramatic, I know, but when you pour yourself into someone like that, they become this mirror. You start seeing yourself through them. And when they’re gone… it’s like the mirror shatters. You don’t even know who you are anymore.”

In the aftermath of the breakup, Bonny felt adrift, unable to reconcile the pieces of his life that once fit so perfectly together. That’s when he stumbled upon the music of Montell Fish.

“It wasn’t just music,” he says, leaning forward, his tone sharpening with passion. “It was like he was speaking directly to me. His lyrics, his voice, the way he poured his soul into every note—it wasn’t just art; it was therapy. He was saying the things I didn’t know how to say, feeling the things I didn’t know how to feel.”

Bonny describes how Montell Fish’s music became more than a soundtrack to his life; it became a guide, a way to navigate the pain.

“I started getting into character, you know? Like him. His music has this vibe—it’s introspective, vulnerable, spiritual even. And I found myself mirroring that. It was like, for the first time, I had permission to feel everything. The sadness, the confusion, the anger—it all became a part of me, almost like a new identity. I think I got so deep into it, I forgot who I actually was.”

There’s a pause. A long, heavy silence where you can almost see him grappling with the truth of his own words.

“It’s weird,” he admits, a faint smile breaking the tension. “Because while I was losing myself in his music, I was also finding parts of me I didn’t know existed. He taught me it’s okay to sit with the pain, to explore it, to let it transform you. But the tricky part is not letting it consume you. And I think… I might’ve let it consume me for a while.”

Bonny’s journey through heartbreak and healing feels universal, yet deeply personal. It’s a reminder of how art—whether music, poetry, or anything else—can become a lifeline in the darkest moments. But it’s also a cautionary tale about losing yourself in the process.

“I’m still figuring it out,” he says, his voice softer now, almost a whisper. “I’m learning how to separate the version of me that was in love with her, the version of me that found solace in Montell Fish, and the version of me that’s just… me. It’s messy. Healing isn’t a straight line, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever fully go back to who I was before. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re not meant to go back. Maybe we’re meant to grow.”

As our conversation winds down, Bonny leaves me with one final thought—a reflection that feels like both a conclusion and a beginning.

“Heartbreak breaks you,” he says, “but it also reshapes you. And sometimes, you need to lose yourself to truly find out who you are.”

A Conversation With bonnysi0 – Part Two

m: So, after everything, after the breakup and losing yourself trying to become what she wanted, do you think you ever figured out who you really are?

bonny: That’s the thing—I don’t know if I’ve fully figured it out yet. After she left, I spiraled. I wanted to mold myself into everything I thought she needed: more charming, more confident, more “manly,” whatever that means. I wanted to be cool in that effortless way that gets under someone’s skin. But the truth is, I lost myself in the process. I started chasing this ideal version of me that wasn’t even real, just this idea I thought women wanted, or maybe just what she wanted.

m: And what happened when you tried to be that person?

bonny: I didn’t recognize myself anymore. It’s like I became this hollow version of me, this character that I thought people would love. But no matter how much I tried, it didn’t fill the emptiness she left behind. I started listening to artists like Montell Fish, and his music spoke to the part of me that was hurting, the part I was trying to hide. He made it okay to feel broken, to sit in the mess of it all.

m: So, would you say Montell Fish’s music saved you?

bonny: Saved me? No. It’s not that simple. His music didn’t save me—it just gave me permission to be vulnerable. And in a way, that’s where I started healing, or at least trying to. His lyrics felt like conversations I was having with myself, peeling back all the layers of denial and shame. But the thing about healing is, it’s not linear. Some days, I’d feel like I was moving forward, and other days, I’d fall right back into the hole she left me in.

m: Do you think you’ll ever move on completely?

bonny: Honestly? I don’t know. I’d like to think I will. But there’s a part of me that still clings to the memory of her—not because I want her back, but because losing her changed me. She was like a mirror, and when she left, I didn’t just lose her, I lost my reflection. I’m still trying to figure out how to see myself clearly again.

m: That’s deep. Do you ever worry about falling back into the same pattern—trying to be what someone else wants instead of just being you?

bonny: Every day. I think that’s part of the reason I got so drawn to the darker aspects of myself after the breakup. It was easier to live in the shadows, to embrace this ghostly, broken version of me, than to face the light and admit I didn’t know who I was anymore. But I’m learning. Slowly. I’m learning to be okay with being unfinished, with not having all the answers.

m: And what does that look like, being “unfinished”?

bonny: It looks messy. It’s sitting with the discomfort, the questions, the emptiness. It’s creating—writing, listening, feeling—because that’s how I process. And sometimes, it’s just breathing. Giving myself space to exist without the pressure to be anyone other than who I am in that moment.

m: If you could say one thing to the version of you that was trying to change for her, what would it be?

bonny: I’d tell him it’s okay to feel unworthy sometimes, but don’t let that feeling define you. You don’t have to become anyone’s idea of “perfect” to be loved. You just have to be real. And if someone can’t love you for that, then they’re not the one.
