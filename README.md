Finding Myself Through Heartbreak and Music: An Interview

“I gave her everything. My time, my heart, my trust—everything. I knew she could hurt me; deep down, I think I always knew. But I chose her anyway. She was the kind of person who made you feel like the world was smaller when you were with her, like nothing outside of that moment mattered. And yet, despite all of that, she broke my heart. It wasn’t just the end of a relationship—it was like losing a piece of myself.”

As Bonny sits across from me, there’s a weight in his voice, an emotional gravity that pulls you in. He speaks of his heartbreak with the kind of raw honesty that feels rare these days. It’s clear this wasn’t just about a breakup—it was about the unraveling of an identity built around someone else.

“I thought she completed me,” he continues, his eyes distant, searching for something in the air. “It sounds dramatic, I know, but when you pour yourself into someone like that, they become this mirror. You start seeing yourself through them. And when they’re gone… it’s like the mirror shatters. You don’t even know who you are anymore.”

In the aftermath of the breakup, Bonny felt adrift, unable to reconcile the pieces of his life that once fit so perfectly together. That’s when he stumbled upon the music of Montell Fish.

“It wasn’t just music,” he says, leaning forward, his tone sharpening with passion. “It was like he was speaking directly to me. His lyrics, his voice, the way he poured his soul into every note—it wasn’t just art; it was therapy. He was saying the things I didn’t know how to say, feeling the things I didn’t know how to feel.”

Bonny describes how Montell Fish’s music became more than a soundtrack to his life; it became a guide, a way to navigate the pain.

“I started getting into character, you know? Like him. His music has this vibe—it’s introspective, vulnerable, spiritual even. And I found myself mirroring that. It was like, for the first time, I had permission to feel everything. The sadness, the confusion, the anger—it all became a part of me, almost like a new identity. I think I got so deep into it, I forgot who I actually was.”

There’s a pause. A long, heavy silence where you can almost see him grappling with the truth of his own words.

“It’s weird,” he admits, a faint smile breaking the tension. “Because while I was losing myself in his music, I was also finding parts of me I didn’t know existed. He taught me it’s okay to sit with the pain, to explore it, to let it transform you. But the tricky part is not letting it consume you. And I think… I might’ve let it consume me for a while.”

Bonny’s journey through heartbreak and healing feels universal, yet deeply personal. It’s a reminder of how art—whether music, poetry, or anything else—can become a lifeline in the darkest moments. But it’s also a cautionary tale about losing yourself in the process.

“I’m still figuring it out,” he says, his voice softer now, almost a whisper. “I’m learning how to separate the version of me that was in love with her, the version of me that found solace in Montell Fish, and the version of me that’s just… me. It’s messy. Healing isn’t a straight line, and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever fully go back to who I was before. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re not meant to go back. Maybe we’re meant to grow.”

As our conversation winds down, Bonny leaves me with one final thought—a reflection that feels like both a conclusion and a beginning.

“Heartbreak breaks you,” he says, “but it also reshapes you. And sometimes, you need to lose yourself to truly find out who you are.”
